## Swift Playground

### Tell us about the features and technologies you used in your Swift playground.

The beauty of programming is the ability to make a fun and educational piece of software with only fundamental technologies that we take for granted.

That said, I have first and foremost implemented UIKit for everything concerning the user interface. Indeed, the latter is an incredibly powerful and well-established framework that allows the creation and presentation of accurate and precise interface elements, enabling an immersive user experience. Besides, I have also implemented the AVFoundation framework to work with audio assets and to make the overall adventure more pleasant. The calm background music and the subtle but satisfying sound effects efficiently elevate the user's journey through the software's various views and tones.

This playground is a reasonably simple game. Nonetheless, I haven't mentioned so far the star of the show, the one and only, drag and drop. Most of the time, this feature is only present as a commodity in utility and productivity applications. However, this game tries to subvert the norm by making this feature the core of its functionality. I firmly believe that every framework can be as powerful and as practical as one is willing to make them.

Admittedly, there are boundaries in software development, but there is always a way around them. As such, there are no actual limits in programming. Instead, we are bound to set and conform to standards.

I hope that the use of drag and drop, as this game's main feature, provides insight at how a software developer can use all the tools at his disposal. Every one of our crazy app ideas can become a reality!

## Beyond WWDC20 (optional)

### If you've shared or considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others, let us know.

I love coding. Usually, I find myself creating a variety of unique programs, and for different use cases. I always start asking myself questions as in how can I do this or that, if it is worth it or not and so on. These questions mostly come unanswered, but I always seek that coveted answer. I go on a spree, opening a myriad of tabs, searching for a multitude of information, documentation and solutions. Plus, the marvellous communities of Swift, and computer science in general, are particularly tolerant and knowledgable. The unanswered is no more.

The cohesion and mutual respect that exists in these communities make the pursuit of a career in computer science or computer engineering that much enjoyable. I cherish knowledge and learning about tricky subjects, like app architecture, sorting algorithms and the big O notation, is an exciting, yet challenging, part of programming. Jumping headfirst into these complex subjects can yield times of frustration and incomprehension. Although I fancy learning, I still favour taking a giant step only when needed, opting instead for a further pleasant walk along the path of destiny.

## Apps on the App Store (optional)

### If you have one or more apps on the App Store created entirely by you as an individual, tell us about them. This will not influence the selection process.

My sole and unique app in the App Store is called « Huh? • Lexicon & Thesaurus ». It is an innovative app that promotes knowledge. It enables you to search for the meaning of a variety of different words and in distinct languages. It is a unique app, in the sense that it is both robust and simple. I had published that application in 2017 when I was a 13-year-old young teenager. I am entirely responsible for coding the app and designing virtually all of its visual elements. With more than a thousand downloads worldwide, I am very proud of my first-ever app. At its peak, « Huh? » was #45 in the App Store's reference category, in my home country of Lebanon, which is remarkably gratifying. Indeed, « Huh? » is free of charge, and users are always on top of my mind. I hope to learn from what was a side-project and aspire to become a great developer.
